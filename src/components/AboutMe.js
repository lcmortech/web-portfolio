        <h1>Hi! I'm Lauren!</h1>
        <p> I'm a Javascript developer from the New York City area. I started coding back in 2019, and my main focus is web development and building applications for various language learning solutions! I mainly work in front-end, but occasionally set up servers as well! Thanks for stopping by!
